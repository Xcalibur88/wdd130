            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Elijah and I enjoy writing instructions for computers. I started in the industry in 2022 when I got curious about plugin development in the well-known video game Minecraft. What simply started as a way for me to make fun things for friends quickly turned me into a programmer. It turned out there was quite a market on the Minecraft server scene for the full development spectrum including backend systems, networking, databases, websites, and more.</p>

            <p>Fast forward to today and I am now a first-year Computer Science student with the privilege of working for an e-commerce company based out of Utah. When I’m not studying, my primary focus is on the development and maintenance of our backend ETL processes to deliver consolidated and accurate real-time data to our teams. Outside of work, I enjoy my personal projects and trying new technologies. I love learning and am always excited by the rapid progress we see in the computer space.</p>
