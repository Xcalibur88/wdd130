                                    Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river.
                                    The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near 
                                    it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of 
                                    the river that they never left.

                                    Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly 
                                    sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches 
                                    in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.

                                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers 
                                    in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer 
                                    and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer... but families with children 
                                    who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water.
