                                    The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near 
                                    it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of

                                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers 
                                    in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer 
                                    and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer... but families with children 
                                    who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water.

                                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating
                                    scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I
                                    - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of
                                    rapids and river variances. However, most people are
                                    familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so
                                    we often refer to both.
